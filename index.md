# About

I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist interested in the dynamical lives of white dwarfs in binary systems. I use a combination of 1D stellar evolution models and 3D hydrodynamical models to study how white dwarfs interact with their companion stars, and the remnants they form. 

I am currently a PhD student at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu) advised by Professor [Lars Bildsten](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/bildsten). I finished my undergraduate studies at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu) co-advised by Professor [Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=raruiz) and Dr [Josiah Schwab](https://yoshiyahu.org).
