    excerpt: "
    I am a theoretical and computational astrophysicist interested in the dynamical lives of white dwarfs in binary systems. I use a combination of 1D stellar evolution models and 3D hydrodynamical models to study how white dwarfs interact with their companion stars, and the remnants they form. <br /><br /> 
    I am currently a 6th year PhD student at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu) advised by [Professor Lars Bildsten](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/bildsten). I finished my undergraduate studies at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu) co-advised by [Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=raruiz) and [Dr Josiah Schwab](https://yoshiyahu.org).
