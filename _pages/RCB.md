  <br />
  R Corona Borealis (RCB) stars are a class of hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich stars. <br />
  <br />
  Their unusual surface abundances such as enhanced oxygen-18 suggests they originate from mergers between a carbon-oxygen white dwarf and a helium white dwarf. <br />
  <br />
  Shortly after the merger, they expand to giant sizes (~100 solar-radii) and undergo helium shell burning for ~10,000 years. <br />
