excerpt: >
  <br />
  R Corona Borealis (RCB) stars are a class of hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich stars. <br />
  <br />
  Their unusual surface abundances such as enhanced oxygen-18 suggests they originate from mergers between a carbon-oxygen white dwarf and a helium white dwarf. <br />
  <br />
  Shortly after the merger, they expand to giant sizes (~100 solar-radii) and undergo helium shell burning for ~10,000 years. <br />

    title: "The Asteroseismological Richness of RCB and dLHdC Stars"
    excerpt: In this paper ([Wong & Bildsten 2024a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...962...20W/abstract)), we combine MESA stellar modeling and the GYRE pulsation code to investigate the pulsation properties of RCB stars. We suggest that the semiregular, 30 - 100 day variability of RCB stars could be solar-like oscillations, which are stochastically excited by surface convection. We extend the well-known phenomenology of solar-like oscillations to RCB stars and find reasonable agreement in the peak oscillation frequency and amplitudes.
