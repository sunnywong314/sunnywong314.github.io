excerpt: >
  <br />
  R Corona Borealis (RCB) stars are a class of hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich stars. <br />
  <br />
  Their unusual surface abundances such as enhanced oxygen-18 suggests they originate from mergers between a carbon-oxygen white dwarf and a helium white dwarf. <br />
  <br />
  Shortly after the merger, they expand to giant sizes (~100 solar-radii) and undergo helium shell burning for ~10,000 years. <br />

    title: "Mass Transfer and Stellar Evolution of the White Dwarfs in AM CVn Binaries"
    excerpt: In this paper ([Wong & Bildsten 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..125W/abstract)), we investigate the evolution of both white dwarfs in AM CVn binaries. We account for finite cooling time of the helium white dwarf donor, and show that the **initial entropy** (degree of electron degeneracy) of the donor and its subsequent thermal evolution sets the binary **orbital evolution**. We also show that the accreting white dwarf is reheated initially due to accretion, and cools again later. Observationally the accretors are brighter than expected, which highlights the possibility of additional white dwarf cooling physics.
