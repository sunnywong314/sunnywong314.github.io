    title: "Type Ia/Iax Supernova Progenitors"
    excerpt: "I use binary evolution models to understand the progenitor systems of type Ia/Iax supernovae. Our models predict the parameter space and observable properties of **helium star-white dwarf binaries** leading to Chandrasekhar mass explosions, and of **double white dwarf binaries** leading to sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions."

    title: "AM CVn Binaries"
    excerpt: "AM CVn binaries are gravitational sources detectable by space-based missions like LISA. We model the thermal evolution of both white dwarfs in AM CVn binaries, and predict their observable properties for comparison with eclipsing systems discovered from ZTF. "

    title: "Hypervelocity Stars"
    excerpt: "Travelling at 1,000 - 2,000 km/s, these are the fastest stars in the Galaxy. They are believed to be the surviving white dwarf companion stars after a type Ia supernova, and show surface metal pollution and inflated radii. I use 3D hydrodynamical models to understand how they were shock-heated by supernova ejecta, and 1D stellar models to model their subsequent evolution."

# Research

My research broadly asks the questions, how are binary systems with white dwarfs formed, and how these white dwarfs interact with their companion stars. The diverse range of outcomes is intriguing -- some explode as type Ia supernovae, some form gravitational wave sources, some merge as a giant star, and some form the fastest stars in the Galaxy. With the advent of large area surveys like the Zwicky Transient Factory and accurate astrometry from the Gaia mission, we have only begun to probe these stellar enigma in recent years. My goal is to aid our theoretical understanding of these objects through stellar modeling and hydrodynamical simulations.

## Type Ia Supernovae

Type Ia supernovae are some of the most energetic explosions in the Universe. We believe that type Ia supernovae come from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, aided by mass transfer from a binary companion (though binary interaction itself is also debated). Nevertheless, it has long been debated how the thermonuclear explosion happens, and what the nature of the binary compaion is. 

## AM CVn Binaries

AM CVn binaries are a class of ultracompact binaries marked by hydrogen-deficient spectra, and orbital periods below about an hour, down to 5 minutes.
