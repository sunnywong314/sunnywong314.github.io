  <br />
  Double white dwarf binaries begin mass transfer at orbital periods as short as a few minutes. <br />
  <br />
  If the accretor white dwarf explodes, the surviving donor white dwarf is flung off at roughly its orbital velocity, 1,000-2,000 km/s, and becomes one of the fastest stars in the Galaxy. <br />
  <br />
  To date, 7 such hypervelocity stars have been discovered by the Gaia mission.  <br />
  <br />
  They all show inflated radii (~0.1 solar-radii), and surface pollution by heavy elements. <br />
  <br />
  I combine 3D hydrodynamical simulations and 1D stellar modeling to understand how the hypervelocity stars are formed. <br />

## Shocking and Mass Loss of Compact Donor Stars in Type Ia Supernovae

In this paper [Wong, White & Bildsten 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973...65W/abstract), we model the interaction between type Ia supernova ejecta and a low-mass helium white dwarf/ helium star companion.

Here is a zoom-in version. A strong shock propagates through the center of the donor white dwarf, and deposits entropy there.

Due to the entropy deposition, the donor white dwarf expands to
