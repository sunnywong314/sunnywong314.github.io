  Type Ia supernovae originate from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, aided by mass transfer from a binary companion. <br />
  <br />
  Nevertheless, it has long been debated how the thermonuclear explosion happens, and what the nature of the binary companion is.  <br />

    title: "Evolution of Helium Star-White Dwarf Binaries Leading up to Thermonuclear Supernovae"
    excerpt: In this paper ([Wong & Schwab 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...878..100W/abstract)), we investigate the parameter space of white dwarfs stably accreting from non-degenerate, 1-2 solar-mass helium star companions. Previous studies assumed that if the accreting white dwarf reaches Chandrasekhar mass, it will undergo core carbon ignition. We account for the possibility that an **off-center carbon ignition** could occur and convert the white dwarf into an **oxygen-neon white dwarf**. It could then undergo accretion-induced collapse and form a neutron star when reaching Chandrasekhar mass.

## Helium White Dwarf Companions (sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Scenario)

One popular sub-Chandrasekhar mass scenario is the double-detonation mechanism, where a surface helium shell detonation leads to core carbon detonation.
