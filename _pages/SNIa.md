  <br />
  Type Ia supernovae originate from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, aided by mass transfer from a binary companion. <br />
  <br />
  Nevertheless, it has long been debated how the thermonuclear explosion happens, and what the nature of the binary companion is.  <br />

    title: "Pre-explosion Properties of Helium Star Donors to Thermonuclear Supernovae"
    excerpt: >
    In this followup paper, we predicted the **observable properties** of helium star-white dwarf binary systems leading to Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. This is particularly relevant for **type Iax supernovae**, a class of thermonuclear transients that are subluminous and have slower ejecta velocities compared to normal type Ia supernova. Two Iax supernovae have helium emission lines in early spectra, and SN 2012Z had a pre-explosion detection consistent with a helium star progenitor. <br />

## Helium Star Companions (Chandrasekhar Mass Scenario)

In the Chandrasekhar mass scenario, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes material from a non-degenerate companion star and explodes via core carbon ignition when it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass. 

In this paper, we investigate the parameter space of white dwarfs stably accreting from non-degenerate, 1-2 solar-mass helium star companions. Previous studies assumed that if the accreting white dwarf reaches Chandrasekhar mass, it will undergo core carbon ignition. We account for the possibility that an **off-center carbon ignition** could occur and convert the white dwarf into an **oxygen-neon white dwarf**. It could then undergo accretion-induced collapse and form a neutron star when reaching Chandrasekhar mass.
