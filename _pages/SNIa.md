    excerpt: "I use binary evolution models to predict the parameter space and observable properties of helium star-white dwarf binaries leading to Chandrasekhar mass explosions, and of double white dwarf binaries leading to sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions."

# Thermonuclear Supernovae

## Type Ia Supernovae

Type Ia supernovae are some of the most energetic explosions in the Universe. We believe that type Ia supernovae come from thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, aided by mass transfer from a binary companion (though binary interaction itself is also debated). Nevertheless, it has long been debated how the thermonuclear explosion happens, and what the nature of the binary companion is. 

## Helium Star Companions / Chandrasekhar Mass Scenario

In the Chandrasekhar mass scenario, a white dwarf accretes material from a non-degenerate companion star and explodes via core carbon ignition when it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass.
