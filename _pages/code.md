    excerpt: "
    <big>
    Over the past year I have been using the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamics code. I perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations of supernova ejecta interacting with companion stars. I have experience with the adapative mesh refinement, MPI parallelization, multigrid self-gravity, and passive scalar features. Most recently I have started using the general equation-of-state capability. I input the MESA equation of state into Athena++ to allow for the effects of electron degeneracy, radiation, and Coulomb interactions.
