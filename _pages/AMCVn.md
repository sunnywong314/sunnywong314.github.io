  <br />
  AM CVn binaries are ultracompact binaries with orbital periods between 5 minutes and about an hour, where a white dwarf accretes helium-rich material from a semi-degenerate companion star. <br />
  <br />
  Recently a number of eclipsing AM CVn binaries were discovered, allowing us to probe the thermal states of both white dwarfs.
