  <br />
  AM CVn binaries are ultracompact binaries with orbital periods between 5 minutes and about an hour, where a white dwarf accretes helium-rich material from a semi-degenerate companion star. <br />
  <br />
  Recently a number of eclipsing AM CVn binaries were discovered, allowing us to probe the thermal states of both white dwarfs, and their orbital evolution. <br />

    title: "Mass Transfer and Stellar Evolution of the White Dwarfs in AM CVn Binaries"
    excerpt: In this paper ([Wong & Bildsten 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..125W/abstract)), we investigate the evolution of both white dwarfs in AM CVn binaries. We account for finite cooling time of the helium white dwarf donor, and show that the **initial entropy** (degree of electron degeneracy) of the donor and its subsequent thermal evolution sets the binary **orbital evolution**. We also show that the accreting white dwarf is reheated initially due to accretion, and cools again later. Observationally the accretors are brighter than expected, which highlights the possibility of additional white dwarf cooling physics.
