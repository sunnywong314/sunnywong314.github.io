Hello, I am Sunny! I am currently a 6th year PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. [Lars Bildsten](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/bildsten). My research intersects 1D stellar evolution and 3D hydrodynamical models to understand how white dwarfs in binary systems interact with their companion stars, and the stellar objects they form. 

In my free time, I enjoy cycling, taking a walk on beaches, and photography. I recently earned my scuba diving certification.
